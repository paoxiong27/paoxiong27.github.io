			<li class="listHeader"><strong>Personal Background</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>I was born in Thailand in the year 2000 and moved to the United States in the year 2005. From 2005 to 2007, my family moved around from place ot place in North Carolina due to the lack of family and financial ties. Eventually in 2007, my family would settled down in Albemarle, at the blessing of an unrelated person, who also had the surname of Xiong. In 2011 my family would move to Charlotte and stay there until today. In Charlotte, I attended Tuckaseegee Elementary, Whitewater Middle School, then graduated from West Mecklenburg High School as the Valedictorian. In 2019, I was accepted to UNC Charlotte and have been here since then.</li>

			<li class="listHeader"><strong>Background in Regards to This Course</strong></li>
			<ul>
				<li>When I was in high school, I often got bored and did some shifty HTML coding on the side during school. It wasn't the best but it was something I would always do. I've forgotten most of HTML by now, but it was fun. Other than that, I've pretty much been using computers since I was 7 but I didn't have my own computer until I turned 16 and then began exploring the limitless possibilities on the internet. </li>
